You need to have the following dependencies to make the project work:
- nunjucks 
- bootstrap
- @11ty/eleventy

To run/build the project locally use:
- npm run build 
- npm run start 
- the site will be available at localhost:8080

We can deploy the website using github pages and share it with the class during the presentation
